  abstract  = {Photointerpretation requires the use of the proper equipment, the correct types of aerial photographs, and sophisticated instruments, methods, and techniques that have been developed by the photogrammetric profession over the course of more than 100 years. In the course of about 15 years, however, photogrammetry has been transformed by the advent of computer technologies that have added digital imaging and image processing and digital mapping methods such as CAD and GIS to its repertoire. The acquisition and careful examination of aerial photographs, using all the proper instruments, methods, hardware, and software is only part of using photogrammetry to its fullest advantage in environmental forensics and environmental litigation. In the final analysis, the most important part of photointerpretation-as opposed to photo reading-is to use the information presented by historical aerial photos to support logical and consistent reasoning about the processes and human industrial behavior that took place at sites through time and shaped the nature of the environment there.},

  abstract  = {Potential readers/users are students of Photogrammetry, Geodesy, Geography and other sciences, but also all who are interested in this topic. No prior knowledge is necessary, except the handling of standard PCs. Theory is presented true to the motto "as little as possible, but as much as necessary". The main part of the book contains several tutorials. In increasing complexity, accompanied by texts explaining further theory, the reader can proceed step by step through the particular working parts. Most of the standard work in Digital Photogrammetry is shown and trained for example scanning, image orientation, mono and stereo plotting, aerial triangulation measurement (manual and automatic), block adjustment, automatic creation of surface models via image matching, creation of ortho images and mosaics, and others. Not only standard situations are dealt with but also more complex ones, such as unknown camera data, extreme relief or areas with very low contrast. Examples of both aerial and close-range photogrammetry present the power of these type of measurement techniques. The software is not limited to the example data included but may be used for personal projects. Part of the book comprises a complete description of the software. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

  abstract  = {This chapter briefly defines cultural heritage, before considering the relative merits of stated preference methods in relation to revealed preference in deriving economic values for cultural goods. Section 7.2 outlines the distinction between contingent valuation (CV) and discrete choice experiment (CE) methods, before outlining some applications of CV methods in estimating consumer surplus and maximum revenue for cultural goods. Section 7.3 outlines choice experiments, experimental design, and the random utility theory underlying CEs. Section 7.4 presents the standard conditional logit and multinomial logit models, and discusses their use in valuing cultural heritage. The restrictive assumptions of these two models are described as a prelude to presentations of other choice experiment models that relax some or all of these assumptions. These models are: the nested logit, covariance-heterogeneity, heteroscedastic extreme value, mixed logit random parameter, error component, multinomial probit, and latent class or finite mixture models. Applications of each of these models to cultural heritage are provided. Section 7.5 considers how price and economic values are derived from utility estimates. It discusses values directly derived in willingness to pay space, and the importance of calculating market share and of identifying those who are willing to pay for an improvement to the status quo level of a cultural good. Section 7.6 explores how CE models can be extended or enhanced by the consideration of: interaction effects between the attributes of a cultural good; controlling for choice complexity; addressing non-attendance of attributes in respondent’s choices; considering the scale problem; asymmetry between willingness to pay and willingness to accept compensation for the equivalent loss of a cultural good; the issue of utility maximization or regret minimization; the importance of considering respondents’ attitudes in choice models; and models combining revealed and stated preference to include what people actually demand, as well as what they say they would demand, in evaluating preferences and values for cultural goods. The conclusion in Section 7.7 briefly summarizes the chapter and provides some thoughts for future research.}

Appraisal of photographs is difficult to apply because of the unique nature of the medium, but it is essential that the same intellectual rigor applied to other historical textual records be adopted for visual records. This chapter explores image collection development since the late 1960s. A discussion of the importance of selection for analog and digital images and of developing appraisal criteria follows, emphasizing the importance of good selection techniques to ensure that resources are invested wisely. The chapter concludes with the selection of images for digital capture and conversion, a vital component of digitization initiatives.},

  abstract  = {The continuous spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is causing people to feel anxiety and stress. This study constructs a four-layer research model to examine how a 360° virtual tour can reduce people's psychological stress through two types of presence (the sense of presence and telepresence) and affective-motivational states (enjoyment and involvement) in this extraordinary period of the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to test the moderating effect of involvement, partial least squares (PLS) analysis is employed to analyse valid data collected from 235 individuals. The results of this study indicate that telepresence has a higher impact in generating affective-motivational states than the sense of presence. Among the factors, enjoyment shows the highest effect on satisfaction with the 360° virtual tour experience and stress reduction; involvement moderates the effect of telepresence on satisfaction with the 360° virtual tour experience. This study also contributes to virtual reality research by distinguishing the concepts of ‘sense of presence’ and ‘telepresence’ as well as demonstrating the mechanisms whereby virtual reality technology influences people's psychological well-being. Timely recommendations are provided for people in order to reduce psychological stress during and after COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract = {Photogrammetry is a survey technique that allows for the building of three-dimensional (3D) models from digitized output data. In recent years, it has been confirmed as one of the best techniques to build 3D models widely used in several fields such as life and earth sciences, medicine, architecture, topography, archaeology, crime scene investigation, cinematography, and engineering. Close-range photogrammetry, in particular, has several applications in osteological studies allowing to create databases of 3D bone models available for subsequent qualitative and quantitative studies. This work provides a step-by-step guide of the photo acquisition protocol and the photogrammetric workflow for creating high-resolution 3D digital models of human crania. Our method, based on Structure-from-Motion (SfM), uses single-camera photogrammetry to capture chromatic details and reconstruct shape with a scale error of less than 1 mm. Using relatively inexpensive and easily transportable equipment and a quick and simple protocol, realistic and accurate models can be be produced with minimal effort.},
